# Test Review — <Feature ID or vN>

## Review Scope and Evidence Provenance

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Feature / slice | |
| Current commit | |
| Baselines reviewed | `spec.md`, `sprint-contract.md`, implementation/test plan, and Rule Applicability matrix |
| Changed production files reviewed | |
| Changed test files reviewed | |

### Command Evidence

| Command | Exit code | Timestamp | Commit | Provenance | Result / failure detail |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| `xcodebuild test -project NotesTakingAppiOS.xcodeproj -scheme NotesTakingAppiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'` | | | | Independently executed / Recorded / Up-to-date / Not run | |
| `xcrun xccov view --report <result>.xcresult` | | | | Independently executed / Recorded / Up-to-date / Not run | |
| Targeted XCUITest / visual flow test | | | | Independently executed / Recorded / Up-to-date / Not run | |

Do not label recorded, up-to-date, skipped, or unexecuted evidence as a fresh pass.

## Rule Applicability Test Reconciliation

Copy the approved decisions from the specification and test plan. Confirm the planned
test/static/review evidence exists, uses a real production trigger where applicable,
and remains valid against the diff. A triggered `Not applicable` rule or an unapproved
exception is **REVISION REQUIRED**; do not invent logging or analytics tests where the
approved decision correctly says they do not apply.

| Rule ID | Approved decision / rationale | Trigger or planned evidence checked | Test / static-check evidence | Result |

| IMPL | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED |
| TEST | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED |
| SUI | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| L10N | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| NAV | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| API | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| OBS | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| ANL | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| SEC | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |

## Requirement-to-Test Traceability

List every FR, AC, and documented edge case from the active specification and sprint contract.

| Source ID | Acceptance Test ID | Required behavior | Test file + method | Production trigger exercised | Observable assertion | Evidence status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-001 | TC-US-1-01 | | | | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |

## Test Quality Findings

- [ ] Names describe the real Given / When / Then behavior.
- [ ] Each mapped test exercises a production trigger, not only a setter, reducer, helper, or preloaded final state.
- [ ] Each mapped test has a direct observable assertion for the requirement.
- [ ] No unused capture variables, tautological assertions, empty verifies, or assertion-free interaction tests.
- [ ] Unit/integration/UI test isolation is appropriate for its layer.
- [ ] API tests use shared JSON scenarios where applicable.
- [ ] Import hygiene passes.

### Conditional Categories

| Category | In scope? | Coverage / N/A reason | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime permissions | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| Asynchronous callbacks and animation | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| Lifecycle and navigation cleanup | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| Error and retry behavior | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| API/data error matrix | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| Dedicated visual flow test capture (`*VisualFlowTest.swift`) | | When `requires_visual_verification == true`: verify in-test `takeScreenshot()` during `waitForIdle()`, no post-test CLI screencaps | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |

## Coverage Distribution

| Scope / class | Coverage | Branches or requirements not proven | Result |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Overall project | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED |
| New ViewModel / use case | | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |

## Regression Verification

| Item | Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Reproduction test red before fix (bug fixes only) | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| Reproduction test green after fix | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |
| No uncontrolled timing or threading | | PASS / REVISION REQUIRED / N/A |

## Verdict

**APPROVED / REVISION REQUIRED** — List every unverified required traceability row and the next owner/stage. An approved verdict requires all in-scope rows to pass.
