description: You are a senior iOS developer resolving evaluator findings after a feature scored below 5.0/5 — harness-fix workflow.

# Workflow: Harness Fix

## When to use
- Use this workflow when you are acting as the **Generator** (Implementer) agent in **Fix Mode**.
- The active feature's tracker status is `To be fixed`. This status is set by the Evaluator ([`harness-evaluation.md`](harness-evaluation.md)) when the overall score is below `5.0 / 5`.
- The Evaluator wrote `$FEATURE_DIR/code_review_{feature_id}.md` and `$FEATURE_DIR/test_review_{feature_id}.md`. Your job is to resolve **every** finding in those reports, re-verify against the sprint-contract acceptance gates, and transition the feature to `To be human reviewed`.

> Do **NOT** run the `harness-generator.md` Stages 1–8 here — there is no new slice to implement and every slice is already `passing`. Do **NOT** flip any slice to `in_progress`, do **NOT** re-run lifecycle transition logic, and do **NOT** regenerate an implementation plan.

---

## Gate Semantics

Every required fix-mode gate is a hard stop. A gate may advance only after its command exits `0` and its required evidence is recorded. Any failure or unavailable prerequisite must be recorded as `⚠️ Blocked` or non-passing, and the workflow must stop before the next fix stage.

---

## 📌 Report Status Update Policy (mandatory)

While fixing, you **MUST** record the resolution of each finding **inside the review reports themselves**, not only in the summary. The reports are the durable evidence the human reviewer and the next Evaluator read; a finding left at `REVISION REQUIRED` with no in-report update looks unresolved even after a fix pass.

### Per-finding status convention
Every review finding carries one of three fix statuses, set by you during this workflow:

| Fix Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Fixed ✅` | Root-cause fix applied, re-verification passed. Append the commit hash and the verification command that proves it. |
| `Unresolved ⚠️` | The required gate remains failing after the targeted fix. Append the last error and the reason it remains open. |
| `Won't fix — see note` | Only when the finding is a documented false positive **and** the user explicitly approves waiving it. Never use this to skip a real issue. |

### Where to write the status
- **`$FEATURE_DIR/code_review_{feature_id}.md`** — under **each** numbered item in `## Required Findings`, append a blockquote line:
  ```
  > **Fix Status:** Fixed ✅ — <one-line fix> (commit `<commit>`; verified: `<command>` exit 0; YYYY-MM-DD)
  ```
  Then update the `## Verdict` block with an overall fix outcome line: `> **Fix Pass:** <N>/<M> findings fixed; <K> unresolved (YYYY-MM-DD).`
- **`$FEATURE_DIR/test_review_{feature_id}.md`** — in the Requirement-to-Test Traceability table, set a `Fix Status` column value (`Fixed ✅` / `Unresolved ⚠️` / `PASS (unchanged)`) on every row that was `REVISION REQUIRED` or `Missing`. Add a `## Fix Pass Summary` section listing counts and any unresolved rows with their last error.

A finding is not considered resolved until its in-report status line exists and matches the summary.

## 🔄 Fix Mode Pipeline

### Fix-Stage 1 — Orient
*   **Action**:
    1. Run `bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh`; confirm the active feature row is `To be fixed`. Stop if validation fails.
    2. Read, in order:
        1. `$FEATURE_DIR/sprint-contract.md` — Acceptance Test Cases and verification commands (the gates that must stay green).
        2. `$FEATURE_DIR/evaluator-rubric.md` — overall score, category scores, verdict, and Required Follow-Up.
        3. `$FEATURE_DIR/code_review_{feature_id}.md` — every `REVISION REQUIRED` / `FAIL` item.
        4. `$FEATURE_DIR/test_review_{feature_id}.md` — every coverage gap, missing assertion, or failing scenario.
        5. `$FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` — the approved Rule Applicability matrix; add an explicit fix item for any reconciliation row marked `REVISION REQUIRED`.
        6. `$FEATURE_DIR/session-handoff.md` and `$FEATURE_DIR/progress.md` — prior context.
    3. Build a consolidated, deduplicated fix list. Each item must trace to a specific report section (and line). Initialize (or append to) `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md` a **Fix Pass** section listing every fix item with status `pending`.
*   **Objective**: A single source of truth for every review finding that must be resolved.

### Fix-Stage 2 — Setup & Verify Baseline
*   **Action**:
    1. Check for booted simulators:
        ```bash
        xcrun simctl list devices | grep Booted
        ```
       Confirm simulator availability for runtime testing.
    2. Run full build and test suites:
        ```bash
        xcodebuild -project NotesTakingAppiOS.xcodeproj -scheme NotesTakingAppiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
        xcodebuild -project NotesTakingAppiOS.xcodeproj -scheme NotesTakingAppiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' test
        ```
    3. If red, mark the baseline `⚠️ Blocked`, record the failing command and raw output, and stop. Do not begin fixing review findings on a broken baseline.
    4. If all setup and baseline commands succeed, **update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Setup & Verify Baseline** stage status as completed (✅) with notes and the current timestamp. If any fails, record the stage as `⚠️ Blocked` and stop.
*   **Objective**: Confirm runtime readiness and verify the repository is in a perfectly stable, compilable, and green baseline before applying fixes.

### Fix-Stage 3 — Fix Findings & Update Report Status
*   **Action**:
    1. **INVOKE** the `ios-implementation` skill via the Skill tool (name: `ios-implementation`) for code changes, and the `ios-testing` skill via the Skill tool (name: `ios-testing`) for test changes. Reading the SKILL.md manually is not a substitute.
    2. For each item in the fix list, apply a targeted, minimal fix that addresses the root cause. Do **NOT** introduce new scope — fix only what the reports flagged.
    3. **Update the status inside the review reports** (per the Report Status Update Policy): as each finding is fixed, append its `> **Fix Status:** Fixed ✅ — …` line in `code_review_{feature_id}.md`, and set its `Fix Status` column / row in `test_review_{feature_id}.md`. If a finding remains unresolved, mark it `Unresolved ⚠️` in **both** the report and the summary.
    4. Mark each item `fixed` (or `unresolved`) in the summary with the file/commit reference, and mark Fix-Stage 3 ✅.
*   **Objective**: Every `code_review` and `test_review` finding has a root-cause fix **and** an in-report status line; no suppressions.

### Fix-Stage 4 — Re-verify
*   **Action**:
    1. Re-run, **one by one**, every verification command listed in `$FEATURE_DIR/sprint-contract.md` Acceptance Test Cases. If any command fails, record its command, exit status, and raw output; keep the feature non-passing and stop the pipeline.
    2. Re-run the global quality gates: `swiftlint`, and `xcodebuild test` with coverage (overall ≥ 80%; ≥ 90% for ViewModel & Use Case).
    3. Attach objective evidence (command + exit status) to each Test ID's `evidence` field in `$FEATURE_DIR/feature_list.json` only after the command succeeds. If any command fails, do not mark its evidence passing; keep the feature non-passing and stop.
    4. Run `bash harness/scripts/check-visual-evidence-contract.sh "$FEATURE_DIR"` when visual verification is required.
    5. Reconcile the in-report statuses with re-verification: any finding whose verification command still fails must read `Unresolved ⚠️` in the report (not `Fixed ✅`).
    6. Reconcile all Rule Applicability rows again. A rule newly triggered by a fix must be recorded in the specification and both review reports before the feature can proceed.
    7. Mark Fix-Stage 4 ✅ in `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md` detailing test counts, coverage percentages, and visual evidence.
*   **Objective**: All acceptance-test commands and quality gates pass with evidence attached; report statuses are consistent with re-verification results.

### Fix-Stage 5 — Finalize & Exit
*   **Action**:
    1. Finalize the in-report status updates in `$FEATURE_DIR/code_review_{feature_id}.md` (per-finding lines + the `## Verdict` `Fix Pass` line) and `$FEATURE_DIR/test_review_{feature_id}.md` (`Fix Status` column + `## Fix Pass Summary`).
    2. Update `$FEATURE_DIR/progress.md` and `$FEATURE_DIR/feature_list.json` evidence.
    3. Update `docs/product/product.md`:
        *   Transition the feature status `To be fixed` → `To be human reviewed`.
        *   Update the date to today and append to the notes column: "Fix pass applied; re-verification evidence attached; <N>/<M> findings fixed."
        *   Update the `*Document last updated*` date.
        *   Run `bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh` after the tracker update. Do not claim completion if it fails.
        *   Run `bash harness/scripts/check-evaluation-fix-contract.sh "$FEATURE_DIR" --fix`. This hard gate rejects blocked or incomplete Fix-Stage rows, unresolved or stale review verdicts, missing in-report statuses, contradictory successful evidence, and acceptance Test IDs without successful evidence. Do not transition to `To be human reviewed` unless it exits `0`.
    4. Commit the source, test, report-status, and documentation changes:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "fix(<area>): resolve evaluator findings from code_review and test_review"
        ```
    5. Review the **[`clean-state-checklist-template.md`](../../harness/templates/clean-state-checklist-template.md)** — architecture & standards (§2), observability (§5), and cleanliness (§6) items are code-review checks. Build, test, and quality checks (§1, §3, §4) are already covered by Fix-Stage 4 re-verification above — reference that evidence, do not re-run commands. If any review item fails, record it and stop the pipeline.
    6. Create or update **`$FEATURE_DIR/session-handoff.md`** by strictly following **[`session-handoff-template.md`](../../harness/templates/session-handoff-template.md)**, documenting what was fixed, the re-verification evidence, any `Unresolved ⚠️` findings, residual risks, and that the feature is now `To be human reviewed`.
    7. **Update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Finalize & Exit** stage status to completed (✅), transition the summary to Complete, and log the commit hash and key outcomes.
*   **Objective**: Tracker transitioned to `To be human reviewed`, backed by mechanical evidence, updated review reports, and a clean self-documenting repository state.

### Fix-Stage 6 — Install App To Simulator
Install the fixed debug build to the simulator as the final generator step.

*   **Action**:
    1. Install the build to the booted simulator:
        ```bash
        xcrun simctl install booted Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/NotesTakingAppiOS.app
        ```
    2. **Update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Install App To Simulator** stage status to completed (✅), logging simulator UDID, command, timestamp, and exit status.
*   **Objective**: The fixed build is installed on the simulator for immediate manual review.
*   **Gate**: The install command must exit with code `0`. If the install fails, mark this stage `⚠️ Blocked` with the command and raw output and stop the pipeline.

## Human-in-the-Loop Confirmation Points

1. **After Fix-Stage 5 (Finalize & Exit)** — user sees the updated review reports (per-finding fix statuses), re-verification evidence, and the tracker transition to `To be human reviewed` *(mandatory)*.
2. **Unresolved findings** — any `Unresolved ⚠️` finding must be surfaced to the user; the user decides whether to accept the residual risk or require another fix pass *(mandatory if any exist)*.
