# Workflow: Harness Generator

## When to use
Use this workflow when you are acting as the **Generator** (Implementer) agent. This workflow ensures that you are properly oriented, verify safety baselines, implement features surgical-by-surgical, test continuously, and commit clean states back to the repository.

## Planning Authorization

This workflow starts only after the user approves `feature_list.json` and `sprint-contract.md` in one dated `docs/product/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<feature-short-name>/` workspace created by `harness-planning`. That approval authorizes implementation of the selected slice. Do not generate or request approval for a duplicate implementation plan in this workflow; the active feature description, sprint acceptance criteria, design, and verification commands are the implementation plan of record.

---

## Gate Semantics

Every required stage gate is a hard stop. A gate may advance only after its command exits `0` and its required evidence is recorded. Any failure or unavailable prerequisite must be recorded as `⚠️ Blocked` or non-passing, and the workflow must stop before the next stage.

## 🔄 Stage Execution Pipeline

> **Routing**: If the active feature's tracker status is `To be fixed`, **stop here** — this workflow does not apply. Instead, follow the **[harness-fix workflow](harness-fix.md)** in full. It runs the Fix Mode Pipeline (resolve every `code_review` / `test_review` finding and update the per-finding status inside those reports, then transition to `To be human reviewed`). Stages 1–8 below apply only when implementing a new slice (status `In Progress` / `Awaiting implementation approval`).

### Stage 1 — Orient
Before making any changes or planning code, gather complete session and git context. Select the next task to implement.
*   **Action**: **INVOKE** the `feature-orient` skill via the Skill tool (name: `feature-orient`). Reading the SKILL.md manually is not a substitute — the Skill tool is the required mechanism.
*   **Objective**: Run `bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh`, select the approved `docs/product/` workspace from the Harness Feature Tracker by status, reconstruct the prior session, establish the per-slice source of truth (`$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`), record the approved Rule Applicability decisions from `$FEATURE_DIR/spec.md`, and select one task from `$FEATURE_DIR/feature_list.json`. If the slice affects UI, read `docs/product/design_system.md`, the approved feature `design.md`, and its mockups before implementation.

### Stage 2 — Setup
Verify target simulator runtime environment readiness.
*   **Action**:
    1. Check for booted simulators:
        ```bash
        xcrun simctl list devices | grep Booted
        ```
    2. If the command succeeds, **update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Setup** stage status as completed (✅) with notes and the current timestamp. If it fails, record Setup as `⚠️ Blocked` and stop.
*   **Objective**: Confirm simulator availability for runtime testing. Register progress in the summary.
*   **Gate**: The command must exit `0` and identify a booted simulator. If it exits non-zero or no booted simulator is found, mark Setup `⚠️ Blocked` with the raw output and stop the pipeline. Do not advance to Verify Baseline or Implement.

### Stage 3 — Verify Baseline
Ensure that the existing codebase compiles and all tests pass before making any changes. The previous session or developer may have introduced bugs or broken tests.
*   **Action**:
    1. Run full build and test suites:
        ```bash
        xcodebuild -project NotesTakingAppiOS.xcodeproj -scheme NotesTakingAppiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
        xcodebuild -project NotesTakingAppiOS.xcodeproj -scheme NotesTakingAppiOS -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' test
        ```
    2. If both commands succeed, **update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Verify Baseline** stage status as completed (✅) with notes and the current timestamp. If either fails, record Verify Baseline as `⚠️ Blocked` and stop.
*   **Objective**: Confirm the repository is in a perfectly stable, compilable, and green state. If the baseline is broken, stop and fix existing regressions first! Register status in `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`.
*   **Gate**: Both commands must exit `0`. If either command fails, mark Verify Baseline `⚠️ Blocked`, record the command and raw failure output, and stop the pipeline. Do not begin implementation.

### Stage 4 — Implement
Build out the selected feature across the necessary layers.
*   **Action**:
    1. **INVOKE** the `ios-implementation` skill via the Skill tool (name: `ios-implementation`). Reading the SKILL.md manually is not a substitute — the Skill tool is the required mechanism.
    2. **Update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Implement** stage status to completed (✅) with list of created/modified files.
*   **Objective**: All layers successfully implemented, `xcodebuild build` compiles cleanly, UI changes conform to `docs/product/design_system.md` plus approved feature exceptions, and progress is logged in the summary.

### Stage 5 — Test
Verify the correctness of the implemented behavior visually and logically.
*   **Action**:
    1. **INVOKE** the `ios-testing` skill via the Skill tool (name: `ios-testing`). Reading the SKILL.md manually is not a substitute — the Skill tool is the required mechanism. Implement every `Acceptance Test Cases` row in the selected user story. The primary acceptance test must exercise the production entry point; an isolated helper or use-case test cannot substitute for user-visible or cross-layer behavior. Verify through the actual UI/API and meet code coverage targets (overall project **≥ 80%**, ViewModel & Use Case **≥ 90%**).
    2. If all required tests and coverage checks succeed, **update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Test** stage status as completed (✅), detailing coverage percentages and passed test counts. If any required check fails, record Test as `⚠️ Blocked` with the command and raw output and stop.
*   **Objective**: All local tests pass cleanly, coverage targets are fully met, and verification evidence is documented in the summary.

### Stage 6 — Code Quality Fix
Run all static check suites, lint rules, and custom compliance rules, and resolve all violations.
*   **Action**: **INVOKE** the `code-quality-fix` skill via the Skill tool (name: `code-quality-fix`). Reading the SKILL.md manually is not a substitute — the Skill tool is the required mechanism.
*   **Objective**: Diagnose and resolve all formatting, quality, localization, and architectural style guidelines issues, reconcile any newly discovered rule trigger with the approved matrix, and log check success in `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`.
*   **Gate**: All required quality checks must exit `0`. If any check fails, record the failing command and raw output, mark this stage `⚠️ Blocked`, and stop the pipeline.

### Stage 7 — Finalize & Exit
Verify all acceptance criteria, update project state, commit, and prepare for handoff.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Verification Gate**: You **CANNOT** directly or arbitrarily change a feature's status to `passing` in `feature_list.json`. Transitioning a feature to `passing` is a gate controlled exclusively by executing successful verification commands.
>
> **Gate Check Policy**:
> 1. **Identify Gate Criteria**: Read the selected user story in `$FEATURE_DIR/sprint-contract.md`. Every `Acceptance Test Cases` command is a mandatory gate. The active feature's `"verification"` field must reference the same Test IDs and commands.
> 2. **Execute Each Command**: Run every verification command (e.g., `xcodebuild test` or specific test command). Process them **one by one**.
> 3. **On Failure**: If any verification command fails (exit code `non-zero`), record the command, exit status, and raw failure output; keep the feature `in_progress` or mark it `blocked`, and stop the pipeline. Do not continue to another verification command or stage.
> 4. **Validate & Attach Evidence**:
>    *   The status can **ONLY** transition to `passing` if **every** acceptance-test command eventually executes successfully (exit code `0`) — either on the first run or after resolution.
>    *   You **MUST** attach objective evidence for every Test ID, including the command, exit status, fix attempts (if any), and final result, inside the `"evidence"` field of the active feature object.
>    *   If any verification command fails, the status must be marked as `blocked` or returned to `in_progress`. Document the unresolved command and prerequisite.
>    *   A visual-verification owner cannot transition to `passing` unless `bash harness/scripts/check-visual-evidence-contract.sh "$FEATURE_DIR"` exits `0`. This requires a non-empty screenshot and a `visual_evidence/reference-anchor-verification.md` row for every visual Test ID; the row must connect the approved reference to a visual bounds `accessibilityIdentifier`, a runtime assertion, and a concrete measured relationship. The validator also requires each visual row and command to target a dedicated `*VisualFlowTests.swift` method with method-scoped `-only-testing`, so functional tests cannot overwrite visual evidence.

*   **Action**:
    1. Execute the verification gate (see Gate Check Policy above). Attach evidence to `feature_list.json`.
    2. Once verification passes and evidence is attached, update `$FEATURE_DIR/feature_list.json` and `$FEATURE_DIR/progress.md`.
    3. Update `docs/product/product.md` directly:
        *   Update the **Product Portfolio Summary** to reflect the delivered slice.
        *   Add the feature to **Current Product Capabilities** with its delivered behavior and notable implementation notes.
        *   Remove the feature from the **Roadmap — Planned Features** section if it is fully delivered, or update its priority column to reflect remaining sub-features.
        *   Update the `*Document last updated*` date at the bottom of the file.
        *   If every feature in `$FEATURE_DIR/feature_list.json` is now `passing`, update the Harness Feature Tracker status to `To be reviewed` in place and update its date/notes (do not move or rename the workspace). **NEVER transition directly to `To be human reviewed`** — only the Evaluator agent (via `harness-evaluation`) is authorized to make that transition after scoring. Otherwise, keep the Harness Feature Tracker `In Progress` while slices remain.
        *   Run `bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh` after the tracker update. Do not claim completion or commit if it fails.
    4. Commit only the **source code, test changes, and product documentation** for the implemented feature:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "feat(<area>): <short description of implemented feature>"
        ```
    5. Review the **[`clean-state-checklist-template.md`](../../harness/templates/clean-state-checklist-template.md)** — architecture & standards (§2), observability (§5), and cleanliness (§6) items are code-review checks. Build, test, and quality checks (§1, §3, §4) are already covered by the verification gate above — reference that evidence, do not re-run commands. If any review item fails, record it and stop the pipeline.
    6. Create or update **`$FEATURE_DIR/session-handoff.md`** by strictly following **[`session-handoff-template.md`](../../harness/templates/session-handoff-template.md)**. Detail what is working, what changed, unverified paths, risks, unresolved gate items, and next steps.
    7. **Never move the feature directory.** Its `docs/product/` path is stable; only tracker and per-slice statuses change.
    8. **Update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Finalize & Exit** stage status to completed (✅), transition the selected slice summary to Complete, and document key outcomes, open items, and handoff decisions.
*   **Objective**: Ensure all state updates are backed by mechanical, verifiable evidence. Leave the repository in a completely green, stable, and self-documenting state that a fresh session can immediately pick up and resume.

### Stage 8 — Install App To Simulator
Install the completed debug build to the simulator as the final generator step.

*   **Action**:
    1. Install the app to the booted simulator:
        ```bash
        xcrun simctl install booted Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/NotesTakingAppiOS.app
        ```
    2. **Update `$FEATURE_DIR/summary_{feature_id}.md`** to mark the **Install App To Simulator** stage status to completed (✅), logging the simulator UDID, install command, timestamp, and exit status.
*   **Objective**: Leave the implemented feature installed on the simulator for immediate manual review.
*   **Gate**: The install command must exit with code `0`. If the install fails, mark this stage `⚠️ Blocked` with the command and raw output and stop the pipeline. If no simulator is booted, mark this stage blocked with the `xcrun simctl list devices` output and do not claim the generator session is fully complete.
