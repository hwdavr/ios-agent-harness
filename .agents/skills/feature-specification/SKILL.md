# Skill — Feature Specification

## Purpose

Turn a general feature request into approved source artifacts:

- `docs/current/spec.md` — **always produced by ad-hoc workflows**
- `docs/current/design.md` — **produced only for new screens or major UI flows in ad-hoc workflows**
- `$FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` and `$FEATURE_DIR/design.md` — the corresponding outputs when invoked by `harness-planning`

This skill replaces both `screen-specification` and `requirement-capture`. It adapts its depth based on the task type:

| Task Type | `spec.md` | `design.md` | Screen-specific spec sections |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| New screen or major UI flow | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Include |
| Enhancement to existing screen | ✅ Full | ✅ Full (if UI changed) / ❌ Skip (if logic-only) | ⚠️ Only changed parts |
| Pure logic/behavior change | ✅ Full | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |

Do not plan implementation slices. Do not write code. Do not invent missing product decisions.
This skill ends only when every material question has been answered by the user and all artifacts contain no unresolved assumptions or open questions.

## Load

- `docs/product/design_system.md` — mandatory for every UI-affecting specification and design
- `rules/compose-rules.md` — **Keyboard / IME Behavior** section: when screen content or a bottom sheet has text input, the bottom toolbar must dismiss while the keyboard is visible
- `harness/templates/feature-spec-template.md`
- `harness/templates/feature-design-template.md`

---

## Execute

### 1. Capture The Raw Request

Read the user's request exactly as stated. Preserve concrete inputs as source-of-truth anchors, including:

- Named screens, tabs, entry points, and destinations
- User roles or audiences
- Provided screenshots, sketches, or mockups
- Required copy, labels, or product terminology
- Explicit non-goals

If the user provides a screenshot, mockup, or visual reference, save it unchanged under the active artifact directory's `design/` folder and reference it from `design.md` (if produced) or `spec.md`. In `harness-planning`, the active artifact directory is `$FEATURE_DIR`.

### 2. Classify The Task Type

Before asking questions, determine the task type:

- **New screen**: No existing screen serves this purpose. Requires `design.md` + full `spec.md`.
- **Enhancement**: Adds or modifies behavior on an existing screen. Requires `spec.md` only (screen-specific sections only for changed parts).
- **Logic-only**: No UI changes. Requires `spec.md` only (skip all screen-specific sections).

State the classification to the user and confirm before proceeding.

### 3. Ask Clarifying Questions In Chat

Ask targeted questions before writing the artifacts. Prefer 3–7 questions per round.
Questions must be concrete and answerable, not broad prompts like "anything else?"

**Surface assumptions first** — state what you are assuming about the request before asking about behavior; every assumption is a question until the user confirms it.

**Always cover:**
1. **User and goal**: who uses the feature, what they are trying to complete, and what success means.
2. **Expected behavior**: concrete, observable behaviors — each independently testable.
3. **Business rules**: constraints imposed by business logic.
4. **Scope boundaries**: what is explicitly out of scope for this version.

**Cover if new screen or enhancement with UI changes:**
5. **Entry and exit**: how the user reaches the screen/feature, what back/close/submit actions do, and where success/failure navigates.
6. **Core content**: exact data, sections, controls, copy, and required empty/loading/error states.
7. **Interactions**: taps, selection, editing, gestures, validation, confirmation, destructive actions, and disabled states.
8. **State and persistence**: local-only state, saved state, backend/API expectations, offline behavior, and configuration-change behavior.
9. **Design direction**: visual hierarchy, density, references, tone, layout constraints, and responsive behavior.
10. **Accessibility and testing**: content descriptions, focus order, dynamic text, test tags, and verifiable acceptance criteria.

If an answer creates a new ambiguity, ask a follow-up. Continue until the requirement can be written without assumptions.

### 4. Zero-Ambiguity Gate

Before writing any artifacts, verify:

- [ ] Every material product decision is answered by the user.
- [ ] No unresolved assumptions are needed to describe the intended behavior.
- [ ] Scope boundaries and non-goals are explicit.
- [ ] Every user-visible state has a defined behavior (if UI is involved).
- [ ] Every destructive or irreversible action has a defined confirmation/recovery behavior.
- [ ] The user has confirmed the clarified scope is correct.

If any item fails, ask more questions and do not write the artifacts yet.

### 5. Write the active `spec.md`

Use `harness/templates/feature-spec-template.md`.

The spec file must always describe:
- Objective and user goal
- Scope (in scope / out of scope)
- **Technical spec** (libraries & dependencies, key technical decisions, external APIs/services, platform constraints)
- Functional requirements with stable IDs
- Acceptance criteria with stable IDs
- Data and persistence requirements
- Edge cases and error states
- Explicit assumptions
- Open questions (all must be ✅ Answered)
- Verification expectations

**Outcome decomposition (one AC per named outcome):** Each functional requirement decomposes into acceptance criteria covering every distinct behavior its text promises — the happy path plus each fallback, error, boundary, and persistence/compatibility outcome. A single AC per FR is valid only when the FR names exactly one outcome. In particular, a requirement that promises *backward/forward compatibility* or *graceful fallback for missing/unknown input* must include a dedicated AC for each fallback path — a clean round-trip AC alone does not cover it.

**Conditional sections** (include only for new screen or enhancement with UI changes):
- Screen States table
- Navigation section
- Traceability to `design.md`

Do not include an "Open Questions" section with unresolved items. If there are unresolved items, return to Step 3 instead.

The spec is a living document — if a clarified answer changes a decision, update `spec.md` (and `design.md`, if produced) before proceeding.

### 6. Generate Design & Mockups (New Screen or UI Enhancement)

**Skip this step** for logic-only changes.

Before handling either design-input path, read `docs/product/design_system.md`. The active `design.md` must link it and list every explicit user-approved exception, or state that there are none.

**If the user provided a screenshot or mockup image:**
1. Save the user-provided image(s) unchanged to the active `design/` folder (`$FEATURE_DIR/design/` or `docs/current/design/`).
2. Write `design.md` using `harness/templates/feature-design-template.md`, referencing the user-provided mockup(s) in the Design Assets section.
3. Record any explicit user-approved differences between the supplied mockup and `docs/product/design_system.md`.
4. **Do NOT invoke the `ux-design` skill** — the user-provided mockup is the feature-specific source of truth, with the global design system supplying all unspecified decisions.

**If NO screenshot or mockup was provided:**
**INVOKE** the `ux-design` skill via the Skill tool (name: `ux-design`). Reading the SKILL.md manually is not a substitute — the Skill tool is the required mechanism.

Input: The clarified requirements from Steps 1–5, the active artifact directory, and the task type classification.
Output: `design.md` + `design/mockup_*.png` AI-generated visual mockup images in the active artifact directory.

**Keyboard-visible state (any screen or bottom sheet with text input):** If the screen content or a bottom sheet contains a text box, text field, search field, or other text input, `design.md` must define the keyboard-visible state and reference a distinct keyboard-visible mockup asset alongside the base mockup. For a bottom sheet, that mockup must show the sheet **still open** with the keyboard — tapping the text input must not dismiss the sheet; only a scrim tap, swipe-down, or close action does (per the Keyboard / IME Behavior rule in `rules/compose-rules.md`). When the screen has a bottom toolbar, the keyboard-visible state must show the bottom toolbar **dismissed** while the keyboard is visible, per the same rule. The bottom toolbar must never be depicted behind the keyboard.

---

## Output

- Ad-hoc workflows: `docs/current/spec.md`, `docs/current/design.md`, and `docs/current/design/` mockup assets (user-provided or generated)
- Harness planning: `$FEATURE_DIR/spec.md`, `$FEATURE_DIR/design.md`, and `$FEATURE_DIR/design/` mockup assets (user-provided or generated)

**Design-system conformance:** for UI work, `design.md` must link `docs/product/design_system.md` and list every explicit user-approved exception (or state that none exist).

**Keyboard-visible state (conditional — mechanics in Step 6):** if a bottom sheet contains text input, or screen content has text input with a bottom toolbar, `design.md` must define the keyboard-visible state and reference a distinct keyboard-visible mockup asset alongside the base mockup. For a bottom sheet, the keyboard-visible mockup must show the sheet **still open** with the keyboard — tapping the text input must not dismiss the sheet; only a scrim tap, swipe-down, or close action does. When the text input is on screen content with a bottom toolbar (no modal sheet), the keyboard-visible state must show the bottom toolbar **dismissed** while the keyboard is visible. Both follow the Keyboard / IME Behavior rule in `rules/compose-rules.md`.

## Done When — ⛔ MANDATORY STOP

Present the produced artifacts to the user and confirm:

- [ ] `spec.md` exists with all required sections filled and no open questions.
- [ ] `design.md` exists (if task type is new screen or UI enhancement) with all sections filled according to template.
- [ ] `design.md` links to `docs/product/design_system.md` and records approved exceptions (or states that none exist).
- [ ] Visual mockup images exist in `design/` for every screen in `design.md` (user-provided screenshot or generated `mockup_*.png`).
- [ ] No assumptions or open questions remain.
- [ ] The user has approved the specification (and design/mockups, if produced).
- [ ] The artifacts are ready for slice planning.

**APPROVED by user →** Return to the active workflow file and proceed to the Slice Planning stage.
