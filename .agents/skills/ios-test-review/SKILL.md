# Skill — iOS Test Review

## Purpose

Independently review test quality, assertion depth, boundary handling, and coverage
evidence before code review. The canonical report structure and traceability table
live in `harness/templates/test-review-template.md`.

## Load

- All test files mapped by the active plan or sprint contract, plus the production files that implement the mapped behavior.
- `rules/testing-strategy.md` is auto-loaded as a system rule — do not re-read. Also load `rules/testing-practices.md`,
  `harness/templates/test-review-template.md`, and
  `harness/templates/rule-applicability-template.md`.
- Load `rules/testing-runtime-evidence.md` only when the plan or diff makes a
  platform, instrumented runtime, end-to-end journey, or visual claim.
- Load `rules/ios-security.md` when the approved `SEC` row is `Required` or
  excepted, or when the changed behavior newly triggers a security boundary.

If a required baseline or test-evidence artifact is missing, record it as a blocking finding. Do not substitute a prior `test_review_*.md` for the missing source evidence.

## Execute

### B0. Rule Applicability Test Reconciliation

Read the canonical specification's approved Rule Applicability matrix and the test
plan's required-rule evidence mapping before assessing tests. For ARCH, IMPL, TEST,
SUI, L10N, NAV, API, OBS, ANL, and SEC, independently verify that the planned test,
static-check, review evidence, or canonical non-applicable rationale exists and remains
valid against the diff. Do not invent analytics or logging tests when their triggers are
absent; an unsupported decision is **REVISION REQUIRED**.

For `SEC: Required`, also verify the rule's validation,
redaction/fallback, and real instrumented boundary evidence. Missing runtime evidence
is blocked, not passing.

### B1. Establish review scope and evidence provenance

For harness evaluation, run the acceptance-test traceability validator in evaluation
mode before accepting the review. It must prove each acceptance Test ID maps to a real
Swift test method, a suite-scoped command, its declared scenario, and successful evidence:

```bash
bash harness/scripts/check-acceptance-test-traceability.sh "$FEATURE_DIR" --evaluate
```

1. Record the current commit, changed files, selected feature/slice, and the source paths used for review.
2. For every recorded test or coverage result, capture the command, exit code, timestamp, commit (when available), and whether it was:
   - **Independently executed** during this review;
   - **Recorded testing-stage evidence**; or
   - **Up-to-date / not executed**.
3. Do not call recorded or up-to-date evidence a fresh passing execution. Runtime commands belong to Stage 4 of the active review workflow; cite their result once that stage has run.

### B2. Build complete requirement-to-test traceability

List every functional requirement, acceptance criterion, and documented edge case from the active `spec.md` and `sprint-contract.md`. Add one row per requirement to the review report with:

| Source ID | Required behavior | Test file + method | Production trigger exercised | Observable assertion | Evidence status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Use the exact requirement ID where available. A mapped test is **not sufficient** unless it both exercises the production trigger and asserts the required observable outcome.

Mark a row **REVISION REQUIRED** when any of the following is true:

- The requirement has no mapped test.
- The named test method or test file does not exist.
- The test sets UI state, calls a setter, injects a final callback, or pre-populates success state instead of exercising the production event it claims to cover.
- The test clicks a control but does not assert the callback result, state transition, navigation result, system permission result, or user-visible outcome required by the source requirement.
- The test asserts a callback was invoked but does not assert the resulting UI or lifecycle effect where the requirement is user-visible.
- The test is the only caller of a completion callback or state transition that has no production call site.
- The FR names multiple outcomes (e.g. a serialization round-trip *and* graceful fallback for missing/unknown fields, or a happy path *and* an error/fallback path) but only one of them is mapped to a test — the untested outcome must be marked `REVISION REQUIRED`, even when the happy-path test passes.

### B3. Review test quality and boundaries

For every mapped test file, check:

- **Naming**: names describe the real Given / When / Then behavior.
- **Production realism**: the event source, callback, permission result, lifecycle event, or navigation action is represented at the lowest reliable test layer.
- **Assertiveness**: assertions verify the required externally observable result; flag unused capture variables, setter-only tests, empty verification blocks, `#expect(true)`, and unasserted optional unwrapping without a behavior assertion.
- **Isolation**: unit tests isolate external boundaries; integration tests use real in-memory components where appropriate; UI tests use deterministic fakes.
- **Shared scenarios**: API tests use shared JSON scenarios. Flag inline API payloads, including multiline JSON strings, unless the test is not API-related and the reason is recorded.
- **Import hygiene**: no unnecessary framework imports in unit tests, explicit test imports.

### B4. Check conditional behavior categories

When the source requirements include the category below, verify both the success path and the stated failure/boundary path. Mark the category N/A only when the active specification has no such behavior, and state why.

| Category | Required review check |
|---|---|
| Runtime permissions | `Info.plist` usage description where needed, authorization request, grant path, denial UI, and Settings action if specified. |
| Asynchronous tasks / animation | Production completion path is reachable; tests do not invoke completion directly as a substitute for production wiring. |
| Lifecycle / navigation | Dismiss, sheet presentation, back navigation, view recreation, and cleanup requirements use the real lifecycle or navigation trigger. |
| Error / retry | Error state, retry trigger, bounded retry behavior, and user-visible recovery result are asserted. |
| API / data | Every endpoint has success, 4xx, 5xx, malformed payload, and unknown-enum coverage as applicable. |

### B5. Coverage and regression review

From evidence with clear provenance, assess whether coverage is concentrated on trivial code rather than behavior branches. Flag new domain use cases and ViewModels below 90% and overall coverage below 80%.

For bug fixes, confirm that the reproduction test was red before the fix, is green afterward, and contains no uncontrolled timing or threading.

## Output

Produce a report from `harness/templates/test-review-template.md`:

- **Ad-hoc workflows**: `docs/current/test_review_v<N>.md`
- **Harness evaluation**: `$FEATURE_DIR/test_review_{feature_id}.md`

The report must include evidence provenance, the complete traceability matrix, test-quality findings, coverage distribution, and an overall verdict. Update the active summary only after both test and code review verdicts are known.

## Done When

All of the following are mechanically verifiable:

- [ ] Every FR, AC, and documented edge case in the active baseline has a traceability row.
- [ ] Every named outcome within an FR (happy path, fallback, error, boundary, compatibility) is covered by its own test; no FR is approved on a happy-path test alone when it promises more.
- [ ] Every row identifies a real production trigger and an observable assertion, or is explicitly marked `REVISION REQUIRED`.
- [ ] Test, coverage, and runtime-check evidence records command, exit code, provenance, and scope.
- [ ] No mapped test is approved when it is setter-only, assertion-free, test-only callback wiring, or otherwise detached from the specified behavior.
- [ ] API endpoints, permission paths, callbacks, lifecycle, navigation, and errors are reviewed when in scope; N/A rows include a reason.
- [ ] Regression reproduction is confirmed for bug fixes.
- [ ] The active workflow's test-review report exists with an evidence-based verdict.

**APPROVED →** Return to the active workflow and proceed to Code Review.

**REVISION REQUIRED →** Return to Testing or Implementation according to the missing behavior's root cause. Do not approve a feature with an unverified required traceability row.
