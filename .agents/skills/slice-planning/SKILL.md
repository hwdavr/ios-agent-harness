# Skill — Slice Planning

## Purpose

Decompose a complex requirement into independently deliverable vertical slices before any code is written.
Each slice must be end-to-end (Data → Domain → UI → Tests) and leave the codebase in a working, shippable state.

This stage only applies when the feature touches **more than one logical area** or **more than ~3 files**.
For trivially small changes, skip this stage and go directly to the Implementation Plan stage.

## Load

- `harness/templates/feature_list_template.json`
- `harness/templates/progress-template.md`
- `harness/templates/sprint-contract-template.md`
- `harness/templates/platform-capability-matrix-template.md`
- **Requirement input** — read the path from the active workflow's `Input:` line:
  - harness-planning workflow → `$FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` (+ `$FEATURE_DIR/design.md` if present)
  - Other workflows → `docs/current/spec_v<N>.md`

---

## Execute

### 1. Assess Complexity

Read the complete requirement input document (path defined by the calling workflow), including every Functional Requirement, Acceptance Criterion, edge case, scope boundary, data/persistence requirement, verification expectation, and applicable design requirement. Do not rely on a summary, a previous plan, or only the user stories.

Create a **Spec Coverage Matrix** before defining slices. Every `FR-*` and `AC-*` in the spec must map to exactly one primary user story and acceptance-test ID; explicitly map edge cases, non-functional constraints, and design requirements to a user story or mark them `out_of_scope` with the approved reason. Do not omit a requirement because it appears foundational, duplicated, or non-user-visible.

An FR that names multiple outcomes (happy path plus fallback, error, boundary, or persistence/compatibility behavior) must decompose into one AC per outcome. A single happy-path acceptance-test ID is a coverage gap when the FR text promises additional behaviors — if the spec failed to decompose it, add the missing ACs here rather than silently mapping only the happy path.

Then answer:
- How many distinct areas of the codebase are touched?
- Is there a natural dependency order (e.g. DB schema must exist before the ViewModel can query it)?
- Which part carries the highest technical risk or most uncertainty?

### 2. Compile Sprint Contract

Decompose the high-level requirement into a detailed scope, acceptance criteria, and verification plan. Strictly follow the structure in `harness/templates/sprint-contract-template.md` to generate `sprint-contract.md`. Fill in the Sprint Overview (Sprint ID, Feature Name, Duration), Scope (In Scope, Out of Scope), the **Spec Coverage Matrix**, and User Scenarios & Testing (user stories with acceptance criteria and acceptance test cases).

The Spec Coverage Matrix is mandatory. It must include the source requirement ID, concise requirement text, primary user-story ID, acceptance-test ID, and handling. A requirement may map to multiple secondary tests, but it must have exactly one primary owner. Preserve the source requirement ID verbatim so the planning gate can verify coverage.

For every acceptance criterion, define a uniquely identified acceptance test case in the contract. Each row must name the test layer, proposed test file and method, fixture/action, observable assertions, and exact Gradle command. The test must invoke the production entry point for the user story; an isolated helper/use-case test cannot be the sole proof of an end-to-end or user-visible criterion.

Do not let one AC bundle multiple named outcomes — split a multi-outcome AC so each outcome has its own test. A fallback, error, boundary, or compatibility path promised by an FR needs its own AC and test, not a secondary assertion inside the happy-path test.

**Each user story MUST have a unique ID** (e.g. `US-1`, `US-2`, `US-3`). This ID is the cross-reference key used in `feature_list.json` to enforce a 1:1 mapping between user stories and feature slices.

### 3. Choose a Slicing Strategy

**Strongly Prefer Vertical Slices**: Always default to the **Vertical Slices** strategy to ensure that each slice delivers an end-to-end, testable user value and leaves the codebase in a clean, shippable state. 

**Calibrate Granularity**: Each feature item should be scoped to "completable in one session." Too broad and it won't finish; too narrow and the management overhead grows. Calibrate each slice against the incremental cycle in `skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md` — it should be a single implementable increment, deliverable in one Implement → Test → Verify pass.
- *Good granularity*: "User can add items to cart"
- *Too broad*: "Implement the shopping cart"
- *Too narrow*: "Create the name field on the Cart model"

**Apply the Vertical Slice Test (reject horizontal slices)**: For every planned feature, complete this sentence using an *already-reachable* production entry point, not one a later slice will build:

> "After this slice ships alone, a user can observe \<observable delta\> through the existing entry point \<screen or action already in the app\>."

If the sentence cannot be completed — because the slice's only consumer is a Composable, screen, or caller that a later slice introduces — the slice is **horizontal** and MUST be merged into the slice that first makes it user-visible.

A slice fails the test when any of the following hold:
- `affects_ui` is `false` and the slice's only caller is UI or a feature added by a later slice (e.g. a tokenizer, repository, or formatter with no in-slice production consumer).
- `user_visible_behavior` describes a capability observable only *after* a later slice ships, rather than a delta visible after this slice alone.
- The slice's acceptance tests can only prove an internal helper or use case, invoking no production entry point.

A `affects_ui: false` slice is still vertical when an *existing* reachable entry point exposes its change (e.g. persistence or export behavior observed through an already-shipped screen). "Risky" or "foundational" is not a reason to carve out an internal engine: merge it into the slice that consumes it.

### 4. Define Features inside `feature_list.json`

The `feature_list.json` root MUST include a `platform_validation` object alongside `features`. For platform-bound work set `required: true`, `unsupported_environment_policy: "fail_loudly"`, `capability_matrix: "platform-capability-matrix.md"`, `real_boundary_test_required: true`, `real_boundary_test_ids`, `real_boundary_test_files`, and `real_boundary_test_signal`, and declare at least one real instrumented boundary test in the owning slice's `acceptance_test_ids`; the platform capability matrix is generated only in this case. For work with no Android/device/platform boundary — the common case — set `required: false`, provide a `reason`, and generate **no matrix artifact**; the JSON declaration plus reason is the whole contract.

For each slice, you must populate the `features` list in the `feature_list.json` schema. Define each task completely, ensuring that each field is explained and adheres to the following definitions:

- **`id`**: The user story ID from the sprint contract (e.g. `US-1`, `US-2`). This directly links the feature to its sprint contract user story, enforcing a strict 1:1 mapping. **Each feature `id` MUST match exactly one user story heading in `sprint-contract.md`, and every user story MUST have a corresponding feature.**
- **`priority`**: Integer priority indicating delivery order (lower number = higher priority).
- **`area`**: The codebase component or feature area (e.g., `comments`, `folders`, `editor`).
- **`title`**: A short, readable title summarizing the slice.
- **`description`**: A comprehensive detailed instruction mapping the precise code-level logic, domain model changes, and database structures required. **This field specifically tells the generator agent exactly what to do** at a technical execution level.
- **`ui_design`**: A file path to a layout asset/mockup or a reference name from an external design tool (e.g. Figma or Pencil.dev) depicting the UI specifications for the feature.
- **`user_visible_behavior`**: A clear explanation of what observable UI elements, texts, behavior, or default flows are affected by this task.
- **`affects_ui`**: Boolean. `true` if the slice adds, removes, or modifies any Composable, screen layout, or visible UI state. It always triggers UI-focused automated acceptance testing and `android-code-review` SKILL.md §4 during harness-evaluation. It does not, by itself, require a screenshot gate. When `false`, the slice is treated as a non-UI change.
- **`requires_visual_verification`**: Boolean. Set this to `true` only for the final user story that makes the completed visual flow reachable and reviewable. Set it to `false` for intermediate UI slices, including a slice that changes Composables but has no standalone production entry point. A `true` owner MUST include the required `TC-US-*-VIS` rows and state-verifying screenshot commands; `false` slices require automated UI/integration proof for their acceptance criteria but no screenshot gate.
- **`status`**: The progress status (`not_started`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, or `passing`).
- **`verification`**: An array of specific, step-by-step proof required for that feature. A high-quality verification is defined as a set of instrumented tests or integration tests that can be executed directly in the shell to provide PASS or FAIL results. The visual-verification owner MUST also include every state-verifying screenshot command referenced by its `TC-US-*-VIS` Test IDs. A bare `adb exec-out screencap` command is not sufficient evidence because it can capture an unrelated screen.
- **`evidence`**: Terminal output, test reports, or screenshots verifying task completion.
- **`notes`**: Additional technical context or design considerations.

Each task must change **one logical thing** and do it completely, ensuring the codebase is never left in a broken or non-compiling state.

### 5. Validate 1:1 Cross-Reference

Before finalizing, verify the bidirectional mapping is complete:

1. **No orphan user stories**: Every `US-*` heading in `sprint-contract.md` must have a matching feature `id` in `feature_list.json`.
2. **No orphan features**: Every feature `id` in `feature_list.json` must match a `US-*` heading in `sprint-contract.md`.
3. **No duplicates**: Feature IDs are unique by definition — no two features may share the same `id`.
4. **No dropped spec requirements**: Every `FR-*` and `AC-*` in the source spec appears in the Spec Coverage Matrix and maps to a user story and primary acceptance-test ID, unless it is explicitly approved as out of scope with its reason.
5. **No under-covered FR outcomes**: Every distinct behavior named in an `FR-*` (happy path, fallback, error, boundary, backward/forward compatibility, graceful fallback) maps to its own AC and test. One happy-path test is insufficient when the FR text promises additional behaviors.
6. **No invented scope**: Every planned capability, acceptance criterion, and verification requirement traces back to the source spec or an explicitly recorded user decision.
7. **`requires_visual_verification` ↔ `TC-US-*-VIS` consistency**: For every feature with `"requires_visual_verification": true`, the matching `US-*` user story in `sprint-contract.md` MUST contain the visual-state rows needed to assess the completed flow, and each row's state-verifying `Exact command` MUST appear verbatim in the feature's `verification` array. A feature with `"requires_visual_verification": false` MUST contain no `TC-US-*-VIS` row. `affects_ui` alone does not require a screenshot gate.
8. **One visual-verification owner**: If the planned feature contains UI changes, select exactly one final, user-reachable slice as the visual-verification owner. Its acceptance tests must navigate through the completed production flow before capturing. Do not attach screenshot rows to intermediate slices merely because they change a Composable.
9. **No horizontal slices**: Every feature passes the Vertical Slice Test from step 3 — it has an observable, already-reachable entry point when shipped alone. A slice whose only consumer is a later slice's UI is horizontal and must be merged into that later slice.

If a user story is too large to fit into a single feature slice, **split the user story** in the sprint contract first, then create the corresponding feature. If a feature slice doesn't map to any user story, either the sprint contract is missing a story or the slice should be merged into another feature.

### 6. Order Tasks

Place the riskiest or most foundational slice first.
Express the dependency order explicitly (linear or branching).

## Output

Write the **feature list** following `harness/templates/feature_list_template.json`.
Write the **progress file** following `harness/templates/progress-template.md`.
Write the **sprint contract** following `harness/templates/sprint-contract-template.md`.
Write the **platform capability matrix** following `harness/templates/platform-capability-matrix-template.md` — only for platform-bound features (`platform_validation.required: true`); non-platform features generate no matrix artifact.

Every `feature_list.json` MUST include the root `platform_validation` object described in Step 4 — `required`, `unsupported_environment_policy: "fail_loudly"`, plus `capability_matrix` and the `real_boundary_test_*` fields for platform-bound work, or `required: false` plus a `reason` (and no matrix) otherwise.

Output paths are defined by the calling workflow:
- **harness-planning workflow** → `$FEATURE_DIR/feature_list.json`, `$FEATURE_DIR/progress.md`, and `$FEATURE_DIR/sprint-contract.md` (plus `$FEATURE_DIR/platform-capability-matrix.md` only when platform-bound)
- **Other workflows** → `docs/current/feature_list.json`, `docs/current/progress.md`, and `docs/current/sprint-contract.md` (matrix path per the calling workflow)

Pre-populate the task list with all slices.
Set Feature 1 to `in_progress`, all others to `not_started`.
