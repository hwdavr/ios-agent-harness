# Skill — Feature Requirement Capture

## Purpose

Capture a complete, unambiguous picture of the feature before any design or implementation work begins.
**Do not write any code. Do not design architecture. Do not slice tasks.**
This stage ends only when every open question has been answered by the user.

---

## Load
- `harness/templates/requirement-summary-template.md`

---

## Execute

### 1. Read and Understand the Request

Read the user's feature request in full. Do not assume anything that is not explicitly stated. Anything you must assume to proceed is written down and flagged as a risk (Explicit Assumptions) — never silently filled.

### 2. Draft the Requirement Summary

Populate every section below. If a section cannot be filled from the available information, mark it with `⚠️ OPEN QUESTION` and add a numbered entry to the Open Questions section.

#### Sections to capture:

**Requirement Summary**
One paragraph. What is being built, end-to-end, in plain language.

**User Goal**
What does the user want to achieve? Write from the user's perspective.
_"As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [outcome]."_

**Expected Behavior**
A numbered list of concrete, observable behaviors. Each item should be independently testable. Vague wording (e.g. "make search faster") must be reframed into concrete, verifiable outcomes the user can confirm or reject.

**Business Rules**
Constraints imposed by business logic (e.g. "a note can only belong to one folder", "free users cannot create more than 10 notes").
If none, write: _None identified._

**Known Constraints**
Technical or platform constraints already known (e.g. "must support minSdk 24", "must not require network for offline mode").

**Non-Goals**
What is explicitly out of scope for this feature. Be specific.

**Explicit Assumptions**
Things assumed to be true that have not been confirmed. Each assumption is a risk — flag it.

**Open Questions**
Numbered list of questions that must be answered before implementation can begin.
Format each as:
```
Q1. <question>
   → Status: ⚠️ Unanswered / ✅ Answered: <answer>
```

---

### 3. Resolve All Open Questions

- Present the draft `requirement-summary.md` to the user.
- For each `⚠️ Unanswered` question, ask the user directly.
- Update the document with confirmed answers.
- **Do not advance to the next stage until every question is marked ✅ Answered.**

---

## Output

Write **`docs/current/requirement-summary.md`** following **`harness/templates/requirement-summary-template.md`** exactly.

**Save Design Screenshot**: If the user provides a design screenshot, mockup, or layout visual in their prompt, you **MUST** save the original design screenshot to **`docs/current/design/`** at this stage so that it is permanently preserved and can be referenced during Slice Planning and UI implementation.

---

## Done When — ⛔ MANDATORY STOP

**Present `requirement-summary.md` to the user and confirm:**

- [ ] Every section is filled — no `⚠️ OPEN QUESTION` or `⚠️ Unanswered` markers remain
- [ ] Original design screenshot saved to `docs/current/design/` (if UI changes are involved and mockup is provided)
- [ ] Expected behaviors are concrete and independently testable
- [ ] Non-goals are explicit (scope is bounded)
- [ ] All assumptions are listed and accepted by the user
- [ ] User has explicitly confirmed the document is correct

**Do not proceed to Slice Planning until the user approves this document.**

**APPROVED by user →** Return to the active workflow file and proceed to the Slice Planning stage.
