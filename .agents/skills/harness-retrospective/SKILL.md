# Harness Retrospective

## Purpose

Repair the repository harness when it allows incorrect evidence, hides unavailable environments, or fails to catch a recurring workflow defect. Preserve the application and product contract while making the harness detect the problem earlier and fail clearly.

## Scope Boundary

Work only on harness-environment concerns:

- `.agents/workflows/`, `.agents/rules/`, and `.agents/gates/` instructions;
- `harness/templates/` and harness artifact schemas;
- `harness/scripts/` validators, environment probes, and contract tests;
- test fixtures that validate harness behavior;
- `docs/knowledge/pitfalls/` and `docs/changes/` audit records.

Do not fix or reinterpret:

- product or acceptance-specification gaps;
- model capability, model quality, OEM behavior, or platform-service limitations;
- application source defects or feature implementation;
- lifecycle status transitions, slice selection, or implementation authorization.

If the root cause is outside the scope boundary, classify it, document the evidence, and stop the repair. Improve only the harness detection and handoff if that is independently useful.

## Root-Cause Classification

Classify before editing. Use exactly one primary classification:

| Classification | Meaning | Skill action |
|---|---|---|
| `HARNESS_ENVIRONMENT` | A workflow, gate, validator, fixture, environment probe, or evidence rule allowed a false pass or misleading result. | Repair and regression-test the harness. |
| `WORKFLOW_GAP` | The correct rule exists nowhere or is not attached to the required stage. | Add it to the authoritative workflow/template/gate and test enforcement. |
| `TEST_EVIDENCE_GAP` | The test runner or evidence schema cannot prove the required boundary. | Add a mechanical evidence requirement; do not implement the product behavior. |
| `SPEC_GAP` | The expected product behavior or acceptance criteria are ambiguous, conflicting, or absent. | Stop; route to Planner/Product Owner. |
| `MODEL_OR_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY` | The runtime, model, OEM, SDK, or service cannot provide the requested capability. | Stop; route to product/architecture decision. Add only fail-loud diagnostics if needed. |
| `APPLICATION_DEFECT` | The harness correctly exposed a defect in shipped application behavior. | Stop; route to the application bug-fixing workflow. |

Never relabel a `SPEC_GAP`, `MODEL_OR_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY`, or `APPLICATION_DEFECT` as a harness issue just to keep working.

## Workflow

### 1. Orient and preserve state

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/ios-architecture.md` (skip if already loaded this session). `rules/testing-strategy.md` is auto-loaded as a system rule.
2. Read the specific workflow, gate, template, or validator named by the incident. Read it completely before editing.
3. Run `bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh` when the incident concerns a complex feature. Do not change the tracker or select a slice.
4. Collect the smallest raw evidence set: failing command, exit code, relevant log, artifact path, and the harness rule that should have caught it.
5. Check `git status --short` and preserve unrelated user changes.

### 2. Reproduce the harness failure

Create or identify a minimal fixture that demonstrates the incorrect behavior. Prefer a contract test over an informal manual check.

The fixture must make the failure observable, for example:

- missing capability matrix is accepted;
- `Pending`, `Unavailable`, or `Skipped` runtime evidence is accepted;
- a fake adapter is accepted as the only platform proof;
- a stale fixture fails for the wrong reason;
- a validator reports a misleading error before reaching the intended assertion.

Do not alter application code to make the fixture pass.

### 3. Define the invariant

Write the intended invariant in one sentence before patching. Examples:

- “A required runtime that was not executed cannot produce passing evidence.”
- “A platform-bound feature requires a real instrumented boundary test; fake/run tests are supplemental.”
- “A contract fixture must reach the condition it claims to test.”

The invariant must be enforceable by a script, test, or required artifact—not only by reviewer memory.

### 4. Patch the authoritative source

Make the smallest change that closes the gap at its source:

- Update the workflow, rule, gate, schema, or template that allowed the failure.
- Add or tighten the validator or environment probe that enforces the invariant.
- Add a focused regression fixture or contract test that reproduces the old false pass and proves rejection now.
- Add a knowledge pitfall only when the lesson is reusable beyond the incident.

Use `apply_patch` for file edits. Do not add suppressions, exclusions, warning-only paths, silent skips, or broad “best effort” fallbacks. Do not modify product code, product requirements, model behavior, or platform capabilities while acting as this skill.

### 5. Enforce fail-loud environment behavior

For every required emulator, physical device, model, locale, permission, hardware feature, SDK, or external service, require one of these outcomes:

1. The check runs and exits successfully with observable, source-fed evidence; or
2. The check exits nonzero and records `Blocked` or `Revise` with the missing prerequisite.

Missing, skipped, warning-only, empty, fake-only, or unexecuted evidence must never be recorded as passing. A product-approved fallback is allowed only when it is explicitly represented in the capability matrix and covered by a test. Keep unsupported environments diagnosable instead of converting them into green results.

### 6. Validate the harness change

Run the narrowest relevant checks, then the project gates affected by the change. Typical checks are:

```bash
bash -n <changed-shell-scripts>
bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh
bash harness/scripts/check-stage-artifacts.sh <workflow> <stage> <feature-dir>
bash harness/scripts/check-platform-evidence.sh <feature-dir> --planning
bash harness/scripts/check-platform-evidence.sh <feature-dir> --evaluate
bash harness/scripts/tests/<relevant-contract-test>.sh
git diff --check
```

Expected negative cases must be asserted as expected failures in a contract test; do not hide them with `|| true` or suppress their output. Run Android build, unit, coverage, lint, or instrumented checks when the harness change affects app compilation or that gate’s behavior. Otherwise, state explicitly that no app source changed and why those gates were not relevant.

### 7. Record and hand off

Create `docs/changes/harness-retro-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>/retrospective.md` with:

- Incident: trigger, observed evidence, and affected stage.
- Classification and root cause.
- The invariant added.
- Harness change: workflow/rule/gate, validator/template, and regression fixture.
- Verification commands and results.
- Routed items that are intentionally outside harness scope.
- Remaining risk.

Quote exact artifact paths and one-line excerpts so a reviewer can verify the change. If the incident is a specification, model-capability, platform-capability, or application defect, route it clearly and leave the harness unchanged except for an independently justified fail-loud diagnostic or handoff improvement.

## Completion Criteria

The retrospective is complete only when:

- The failure has an explicit root-cause classification.
- The authoritative workflow, rule, gate, template, or validator is minimally repaired.
- A regression fixture proves the old false pass is rejected.
- Required unavailable environments cannot pass silently.
- Out-of-scope product, specification, model, and application concerns are routed rather than “fixed” here.
- Relevant validators and contract tests pass, including the expected negative cases.
- The retrospective artifact records commands, results, paths, excerpts, and remaining risk.
- The working tree and any lifecycle state remain accurate; no slice is selected or transitioned merely to complete the retrospective.
