# Skill — Requirement, Impact & Design Analysis

## Purpose
Understand what is being built, identify affected files, and design the core UI state and navigation before implementation.
Do not write any code in this stage.

---

## Load
- `rules/ios-architecture.md`
- `rules/implementation-rules.md`
- `rules/testing-strategy.md`
- `rules/swiftui-rules.md`
- `rules/localization-rules.md`
- `rules/navigation-rules.md`
- `rules/api-contract-rules.md`
- `rules/observability.md`
- `rules/analytics-rules.md`
- `harness/templates/rule-applicability-template.md`

---

## Execute

### 1. Requirement & Impact Analysis
1. Read the user's feature request in full. Do not assume anything that is not explicitly stated.
2. Search the codebase for all affected files (Screens, ViewModels, UseCases, Repos, DTOs, Tests).
3. Classify changes (`modify`, `extend`, `new`, `delete`).
4. **API & Contract Check**:
   - Classify API changes and state force update requirement.
   - **Identify needed APIs**: List all existing or new endpoints that must be called to fulfill the requirement.
5. **Rule Applicability**:
   - Copy the complete matrix from `harness/templates/rule-applicability-template.md`.
   - Record a decision for all nine rules before planning: `Required`, `Not applicable — <feature-specific reason>`, or `Exception — approved by <user/date>`.
   - For every `Required` row, record the concrete trigger and planned evidence. Do not delete a conditional-rule row when its trigger is absent.
   - Analytics and observability must be assessed, not assumed. Use `Not applicable — analytics: none` when no product event is justified; do not add logging or analytics only to satisfy the matrix.

### 2. UI State & Navigation Design
1. **Design UiState**: For any new or modified screen, define all possible states (Loading, Success, Empty, Error).
   - Prefer a single value-type Swift `struct` and expose it from an `@Observable` ViewModel.
2. **Design Navigation**: If navigation is affected, define routes, serializable arguments, and back-stack behavior.
3. **Dependency scope**: Identify ownership and construction boundaries for new dependencies; use initializer injection and keep ViewModels independent of data-layer types.

## Output

Create `docs/current/` if needed. Choose the next unused `v<N>` and preserve existing
artifacts; never delete an earlier feature's evidence.

If the user provides a design screenshot or mockup, save it to **`docs/current/design/`** so it can be referenced during UI Verification.

Produce **`docs/current/summary_v<N>.md`** — create this file **first**, before `spec_v<N>.md`.
Use the template from `harness/templates/summary-template.md`.
The Stage Progress table must list every stage from the **active workflow** in order.
Copy the matching table from `harness/templates/summary-template.md`; do not maintain a
second table here.

All **Timestamp** values must be in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format:

**Type**: feature / bugfix / api / refactor
**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Status**: In Progress / Complete

Mark the first row as ✅ Complete when this stage's gate passes.

Produce **`spec_v<N>.md`** (inside `docs/current/`).
Use the template from `harness/templates/spec-template.md`.
- Record every assumption the analysis required — never silently fill an ambiguous requirement.
- Reframe vague requests into concrete, testable verification expectations the user can confirm.
- Include the complete **Rule Applicability** matrix with a concrete decision, trigger or
  rationale, and planned evidence for all nine rules.
- Keep the spec alive — when scope or decisions change, update `spec_v<N>.md` first.

## Done When

**This stage is complete when all of the following are true:**
- [ ] `docs/current/summary_v<N>.md` exists with the Stage Progress table filled in.
- [ ] `docs/current/spec_v<N>.md` exists with requirement, impact, and design sections filled.
- [ ] Every affected file is listed with a change type.
- [ ] UiState design covers all visual states.
- [ ] API change is classified.
- [ ] Rule Applicability contains all nine rows with no implicit or missing decision.

**APPROVED →** Return to the active workflow file and proceed to the next stage defined there.
