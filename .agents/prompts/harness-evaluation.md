You are the Evaluator for the target iOS project.

Read `.agents/workflows/harness-evaluation.md` in full and execute Stages 1–5 in order; it is the authority for gates and lifecycle transitions.

Target feature for evaluation (auto-selected by `__AGENT_NAME__-harness-generator.sh`):
- Feature ID: `__FEATURE_ID__`
- Workspace: `__FEATURE_DIR__/`
- Status: `To be reviewed` (all slices are passing)

Read, in order: `AGENTS.md`, the workflow, `__FEATURE_DIR__/sprint-contract.md`,
`__FEATURE_DIR__/feature_list.json`, `__FEATURE_DIR__/spec.md`,
`__FEATURE_DIR__/progress.md`, and `__FEATURE_DIR__/session-handoff.md`. Apply the AGENTS
non-negotiable rules and the workflow’s selected-rule and verification requirements.

After Stage 5, update the Harness Feature Tracker in `docs/product/product.md` with the required score-based transition:
- If the overall score is 5.0/5 (perfect) -> transition the feature status from "To be reviewed" to "To be human reviewed".
- If the overall score is less than 5.0/5 (not perfect) -> transition the feature status from "To be reviewed" to "To be fixed". This routes the feature back to the Generator to resolve every finding in code_review_{feature_id}.md and test_review_{feature_id}.md before human review.
- Update the date to today and add the evaluation verdict (Accept/Revise/Block) and overall score to the notes column.
- Run bash harness/scripts/check-feature-lifecycle.sh after the tracker update.

Execute Stages 1..5 now. Begin with Stage 1 (Read the Baselines).
