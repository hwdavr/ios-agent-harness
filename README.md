# iOS Agent Harness

> A battle-tested development, execution, and evaluation harness for AI coding agents to build, verify, and maintain production-grade iOS applications safely, deterministically, and with high code quality.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Modern AI coding agents (such as Google Antigravity, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot) possess strong code generation capabilities but can easily deviate into architecture violations, bloated context windows, untested edge cases, and hallucinations when unconstrained.

This repository provides an **Agent Harness** designed to:
- **Raise the Quality Floor**: Mandate strict architecture layers (Data, Domain, UI), SwiftUI best practices, unidirectional state flow, and comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, UI).
- **Lower the Blast Radius**: Enforce incremental vertical slices, strict stage gates, and deterministic quality checks before code lands.
- **Optimize Context Efficiency**: Use a 3-tier layered context loading protocol (L1 / L2 / L3) to keep context windows under 40% fill.
- **Separate Agent Roles**: Distinct execution modes for **Planner**, **Coder / Generator**, and **Evaluator**.

## 🚀 Setting Up the Harness in Your iOS Project

### 1. Add as a Git Submodule

From your iOS project root:

```bash
git submodule add -b main git@github.com:hwdavr/ios-agent-harness.git .harness
```

### 2. Create Root Symlinks

Create symlinks at the root of your project pointing into the `.harness` submodule:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
ln -s .harness/.agents .agents
ln -s .harness/harness harness
```

### 3. Copy `AGENTS.md` to Project Root

Copy or adapt `.harness/AGENTS.md` to your project root so agent tools can discover it immediately:

```bash
cp .harness/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md
```

## 🧠 Context Management Protocol (L1 / L2 / L3)

To prevent LLM performance degradation and context dilution, context is loaded in strict layers:

| Layer | When to Load | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Always Loaded** | Every session start | `AGENTS.md` + `rules/ios-architecture.md` + `rules/testing-strategy.md` |
| **L2 — Phase-Triggered** | During active workflow stage | The exact skill(s) specified in the active stage's `Load` instruction (e.g. `ios-implementation`, `ui-verification`) |
| **L3 — On-Demand** | When specifically needed | Specific rules (`swiftui-rules.md`, `api-contract-rules.md`), `docs/knowledge/`, OpenAPI schemas |

> **Rule:** Never preload all rules and skills upfront. Only load what the active stage requires.

## 🔄 Workflows & Execution Pipelines

### Project-Based Development (Complex Features)
Used for multi-slice, significant features requiring systematic requirement analysis and evaluation:

1. **Planning (`.agents/workflows/harness-planning.md`)**
   - Clarifies ambiguities and generates `spec.md` and `design.md`.
   - Decomposes requirements into vertical slices in `feature_list.json` and schedules a `sprint-contract.md`.
2. **Generation (`.agents/workflows/harness-generator.md`)**
   - Implements each vertical slice incrementally (Data → Domain → UI → Tests → Quality Gates).
   - Validates each slice before advancing to the next.
3. **Evaluation (`.agents/workflows/harness-evaluation.md`)**
   - Conducts independent code, test, visual, and architectural reviews against evaluation rubrics.
4. **Fixing (`.agents/workflows/harness-fix.md`)**
   - Resolves any findings if evaluation score is below 5.0/5.

### Ad-Hoc Development (Simple Tasks & Bug Fixes)
- **`feature-delivery.md`**: Direct end-to-end implementation for simple features.
- **`bug-fixing.md`**: Reproduction test first → surgical fix → regression verification.
- **`create-ui-and-verify.md`**: Focused on pixel-perfect SwiftUI styling against design mockups.
- **`feature-review.md`**: Pre-merge independent review checklist.

## 🛠️ Automated Scripts & Rule Checkers

The harness includes validation scripts located in `harness/scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check-full-source-rules.sh` | Repository-wide bundle: architecture, SwiftUI, localization, navigation, assertion, and AI security rules |
| `check-architecture-rules.sh` | Validates layer boundaries, file imports, and DTO isolation |
| `check-swiftui-rules.sh` | Checks SwiftUI best practices, `accessibilityIdentifier` presence, and statelessness |
| `check-localization-rules.sh` | Detects hardcoded strings in UI views |
| `check-ai-security-rules.sh` | Evaluates AI prompt/credential logging, WebView boundary policies, and HTML sinks |
| `check-feature-lifecycle.sh` | Validates feature tracking state and artifact integrity |
| `check-visual-evidence-contract.sh` | Enforces visual screenshot verification artifacts |
| `check-evaluation-fix-contract.sh` | Enforces deterministic evaluator scoring, evidence, and fix-stage routing |
| `check-test-assertions-quality.sh` | Ensures tests do not use shallow/envelope-only assertions |
| `check-rules-matrix-contract.sh` | Validates enforcement-matrix rows, summaries, and scripted owners |

Run any check directly from your project root:
```bash
bash harness/scripts/check-full-source-rules.sh
bash harness/scripts/check-architecture-rules.sh
bash harness/scripts/check-swiftui-rules.sh
bash harness/scripts/check-localization-rules.sh
bash harness/scripts/check-rules-matrix-contract.sh
bash harness/scripts/check-evaluation-fix-contract.sh <feature-dir> --evaluation
```

## 🤖 Agent Tool Compatibility

| Tool | Integration Method |
|---|---|
| **Google Antigravity IDE** | Reads `AGENTS.md` automatically; executes skills natively via IDE tools. |
| **Codex CLI / Claude Code** | Run `codex-harness-generator.sh` or prompt: `"Load context for the project"` to trigger `context-management`. |
| **Cursor / Windsurf** | Add `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/rules/` to `.cursorrules` / `.windsurfrules` or project context. |
| **GitHub Copilot Chat** | Reference `@workspace AGENTS.md` when initiating a development task. |
